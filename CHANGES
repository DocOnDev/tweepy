All changes made to the library that might affect applications
during upgrade will be listed here.

1.1 -> 1.2
=====================
+ API
    + Added automatic request re-try feature
        Example: API.friends(retry_count=5, retry_delay=10)
                Retry up to 5 times with a delay of 10 seconds between each attempt.
        See tutorial/t4.py for more an example.
    + Added cursor parameter to API.friends and API.followers methods.
      Note: page parameter is being deprecated by twitter on 10/26
    + Update parsing to handle cursor responses.
        When using 'cursor' parameter, the API method will return
        a tuple with this format: (data, next_cursor, prev_cursor)
        Calls not using the 'cursor' parameter are not changed in the way they return.
    + API.friends_ids and API.followers_ids now return a list of integers.
      Parser updated to handle cursor responses. See above.
    + Fix Status.source_url parsing
    + Fix search result 'source' parsing to properly unescape html and extract source
+ Cursor
    Added the Cursor object to help with pagination within the API.
    Please see the pagination tutorial for more details.
    This is the recommended way for using the 'page' and 'cursor' parameters.
+ Update OAuth bundled library.
- Logging removed. Having our own mini-logging system just feels like overkill.
  Turns out it was not really needed that much. Simply just exposing the last
  HTTPResponse object should be good enough for most debugging.

1.0.1 -> 1.1
=======================
+ Fixes
    + Google App Engine fixes (thanks Thomas Bohmbach, Jr)
+ API
    + Added Retweet API methods
    + Added Retweet Streaming method
    + New model: Retweet
    + Updated statuses parser to handle retweet_details
    + Added new parameters for statuses/update; lat & long
    + friends_ids() & followers_ids() parameter changed page -> cursor
    + search() added "locale" parameter
    + expose last httplib.HTTPResponse object received as API.last_response
+ OAuthHandler
    + Added set_request_token() method
    + Added support for "sign in with twitter".
      get_authorization_url() now takes a boolean that when
      true uses the "sign in with twitter" flow.
      See http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Sign-in-with-Twitter
+ Logging
    + Added TweepyLogger interface which allows applications
      to collect log messages from Tweepy for debugging purposes.
    + Dummy, console, and file loggers available
+ Examples
    + Appengine demo (oauth)
+ Documentation of each method in api.py

1.0 -> 1.0.1
============
+ Status.user --> Status.author
+ User:
    + follow()
    + unfollow()
+ API:
    + __init__() signature change; no longer accepts 'username' parameter
      which is now autodetected.
    + added new() method. shortcut for setting up new API instances
      example: API.new(auth='basic', username='testuser', password='testpass')
    + update_profile_image() and update_profile_background_image() method added.
    + Added search API methods: 
        trends, trends_current, trends_daily, and trends_weekly

    + Update to new streaming API methods
    + New StreamListener class replacing callback function
+ Fixes
    + User.following is now set to False instead of None
      when user is not followed.

    + python 2.5 timeout support for streaming API
    + win32 failed import of fcntl in cache.py
+ Changed indents from 2 to 4 spaces
